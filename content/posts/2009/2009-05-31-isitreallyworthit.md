Lately I've been having some serious set downs at my work, a
certain chain of small and unfortunate events of the kind that
really leaves you totally without any steam or motivation.


  **A small prelude:**
    

I consider myself a very motivated person who puts a lot of effort
and time into my professional life, and in most cases I enjoy
giving more than is expected.  

I started as a technical support in the company I work in, and
thanks to the open minded people at my company, I moved up to
R&D after a while, which in my mind was totally amazing.  

Finally a chance to not only to do programming patches and
"_make it work"_Â  fixes for customers, I now had the chance
of not only writing software, but to do that for the users I
personally knew, could enjoy and find useful.

The projects I worked with were a joy for me, as they allowed me
to improve applications that I've been using before for a rather
long while. Furthermore, I was involved with creating new
applications that solved problems that I used to solve for
customers. As a special treat I was able to add features dedicated
to support, solving and helping to solve the daily problems that
usually arises and tackles our great support crew.  

Again, a really positive thing for me. Especially seeing the
software in use.

Not all went perfect, the were quite a few bugs and set backs,
but it was a very good experience for me, and hopefully for the
software users as well.


  **Whoa, that was a long prelude!**


Anyhow, lately all my efforts to give more have kind of
backfired at me.  

Lot's of what I had planned (and often also implemented) were
cancelled over and over again.  

Each time it bothered me a bit, but I kept trying to get the most
of the situation, and as I usually do, and see the bright side of
things.

For some reason today something simply broke.  

I had a small argument about a certain small feature that I thought
was worth having to improve the user experience, which in my mind
could be implemented in a matter of minutes.  

I got a negative response, and although I tried to explain what I
thought was a _simple as__can be_ solution, I kept
getting negative answers.

It was something I simply couldn't understand, why not improve
something when you have the chance to do that? I do understand time
constrains and risk managements, but I simply couldn't get it with
this case due to the simplicity of the matter.

For some reason it totally got to me. it sort of _pissed me
off_ in a way that caused all the latest set backs to come back
to my mind again.

I started thinking if it's really worth it, all this effort and
_"do good wanting"_, perhaps it's simply something naive
about me that will change as I get more experience.  

Should I just become a bolt small in the system? Do only as I've
been told? Where's the joy in that?  

Will the people that don't use the software really be able to
design something that the actual users will find useful? Is it
really my place to question things like that?


  **Anyhow, to summarize things:**
    

I still think it's worth it to invest that extra time to make
things better, and although I might rant about it and write
**#bah** tweets (and way too long posts as
this),  

Getting crappy feelings about set backs is really nothing compared
to the feeling when someone that actually uses the software tells
you it's a joy to use it.
