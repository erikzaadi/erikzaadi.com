[Part 2](http://erikzaadi.com/blog/2009/11/17/BlogMigration-Part2-TemporaryPages.xhtml)

##### This is the first part in a series I'll be doing, describing
the process I went through while migrating my [blogger](http://blogger.erikzaadi.com/)
blog to a hosted blog with the [atomsite](http://atomsite.net) blog engine.

##### Why migrate my blog you ask?

Well, although Google offers blogger as one of their great free services, I wanted more control, and to have the blog engine in a programming language that I'm a bit more fluent with.

###### Purchasing a domain:

Besides just buying one, there were three things that bothered me:
###### Whois
			
Looking up domain names is very easy nowadays, and it can lead to a lot of spam and forgery
attempts.

Most companies that offer domains has a Whois protection program, usually for an extra buck
or two, well worth in my honest opinion.

###### DNS

I wanted to be able to control subdomains and [cname records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record).
			
###### Name
This might seem as a silly thing, especially with the name I chose in the end, but this was one of the most time consuming steps of migrating my blog.

I tried to think of a catchy name, but in the end, I just went with my twitter account name convention.

###### Choosing a hosting provider:

The features I was looking
for were:

1. Subdomains and cname handling

1. Comfortable control panel

1. IIS7 based, ready for asp.net mvc, with PHP modules installed

1. MSSQL Database available

1. Reasonable amount of diskspace

Â 
I researched a bit, read both good and bad reviews of several hosting providers.

I must say that I didn't encounter any web hosting company that didn't have complaints.

In the end I chose webhost4life, both for hosting and purchasing (and managing) the domain name.

I can't say that they've been the best experience, I'll probably blog about that in the future, but they've worked good enough so far.
