Just reconnected to the blog after a small vacation only to see that the entire layout looked awful.
For some unknown reason, not only did [http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/](http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/) block my javascript, images and css files, they deleted my user as well.

Oh well, back to the drawing board..

Until I’ve resolved the issue, I’ve reverted the blog to the current simple theme..
