Ok, here goes the first post..  
  
My name is Erik, and I'll be blogging about ... well I don't know yet.  
I guess most of my posts will be about programming, and my attempts to becoming a better programmer..  
  
One of the thing's I enjoy the most is learning new things that I find helpful.  
Through this blog I hope to be able to share such useful information with you...  

My fiance found it funny that I wrote _"with a vast appetite for new technologies"_, I wonder if that has anything to do with my ever growing ubersexy [beer belly](/images/beer-belly.gif) ...
  
So, here's my TODO list for now:  

* Add more info on my profile
* Learn interesting stuff worth blogging about..
* Perhaps pimp up my blog template

Cheers for now,  
  
Erik
