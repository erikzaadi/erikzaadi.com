As a part of the redesign I’m doing for my [github site](http://erikzaadi.github.com), I wanted to add a comic image of myself (inspired by [@addyosmani](http://twitter.com/addyosmani) and [@davidwalshblog](http://twitter.com/davidwalshblog)’s great avatars)

 

First, as always, lazy part of me tried some shortcuts.      
I googled “cartoonize me”, and spent some time with the Simpsonize me without any good results.       
After a while I found a rather cool site called [befunky](http://www.befunky.com), which allows you to upload an image and do several sorts of effects on it, one being the cartoon effect, which I wanted..

Here’s the result:

Although I was rather pleased with the result, it didn’t satisfy me.

Okies then, if you want something done right, do it yourself, right?

I fired up Adobe Illustrator, and hooked up the Genius Tablet I got for my talented Fiancée and gave it a try.

Here’s the result:

There should be a law forbidding people with graphic “talents” like me to even attempt to draw.

 

This is one of those _“hmm.. it might be better to outsource this..”_ moments..
