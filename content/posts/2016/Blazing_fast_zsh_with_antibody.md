# Some facts:

## Fact 1

You love `zsh`. You can't really work without it.

## Fact 2

It was a while since you gave your dotfiles and shell some love.

## Fact 3

New `zsh` sessions have been slow for a while, and you keep promising yourself to fix it.

# Time for a change!

I've been using [antigen](http://antigen.sharats.me/) for a while now, and I love the syntax.

_However_, `antigen` causes new sessions startup time to really be monstrous.


# Why hello there Antibody!

[antibody](http://getantibody.github.io/) is a simple, almost in place replace for `antigen` written in golang (Yaay!).

Migrating is fast, and the startup time is amazing.

### GO FORTH AND MIGRATE!
