Thereâ€™s an old saying:  
> *A manager is truly tested not by their presence, but by their absence.*

Last week, I put that theory to the test. I was *down* â€” tissues, tea, and a full system reboot. No gifs in Slack threads. No PR reviews. No long-winded analogies in meetings, EVEN NO PUNS (!!1).

And yet, something beautiful happened:  
The team kept building.

Features were shipped.  
Architecture discussions unfolded.  
Feedback loops closed.  
Bugs squashed before I could sneeze in their direction.

I feltâ€¦ obsolete.  
In the best possible way.

## ðŸ§± Building Beyond the Builder

At Port, we put a lot of thought into building resilient systems. But more importantly, we build *resilient teams*.

Teams that:
- Know the "why" behind the roadmap  
- Understand how to navigate ambiguity  
- Donâ€™t wait for green lights â€” they *know where to go*

We talk a lot about single points of failure in infra.  
But how often do we audit ourselves the same way as managers?

If your absence causes bottlenecks, confusion, or a hard stopâ€¦  
Youâ€™re not leading. Youâ€™re *locking*.

## ðŸ§ª The Sick-Day Test

Every team should be able to pass the "managerâ€™s sick day test":
- Can they make decisions without a Slack ping?
- Can they keep momentum without dailies?
- Can they ship without a guiding monologue?

In my case, the answer was yes.  
I watched (okay, *peeked*) from bed as the Builder team ran like a well-oiled CI pipeline. It wasnâ€™t just heartwarming â€” it was *validating*.

They didnâ€™t need me.  
Because we built that way â€” *on purpose*.

## ðŸ§¦ Back to Barefoot

Iâ€™m back now. Shorts on. Barefoot. Pun levels returning to baseline.

But the week on the sidelines reminded me of something powerful:  
Leadership isnâ€™t about being the center of gravity.  
Itâ€™s about designing yourself out of the critical path.

So if youâ€™re a manager, ask yourself:  
What happens when youâ€™re not there?

If the answer is: *"Theyâ€™re good â€” theyâ€™ve got this."*  
Then congrats. Youâ€™re leading right.

If notâ€¦ well, maybe itâ€™s time to start *refactoring yourself*.
