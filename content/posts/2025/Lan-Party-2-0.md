For years, my go-to LAN party game was **Team Fortress 2** which was pure chaotic fun.

(as seen in my [previous lan party guide](//2016/01/09/dummy-guide-to-mac-lan-party-with-team-fortress-2/))

But ever since Apple‚Äôs transition to ARM-based processors, TF2 has sadly become a impossible to run natively on modern Macs.

Enter: `War{sow,fork}`.

This post is a quick guide to getting a LAN party running using these two excellent (and free!) arena shooters.

## War-WHAT?

[Warsow](https://warsow.net/) is a fast-paced, cel-shaded, movement-heavy FPS. It‚Äôs completely free, runs great on older machines, and plays well with macOS via Rosetta.

[Warfork](https://warfork.com/) is a fork of Warsow created after some unfortunate drama in the Warsow project. It‚Äôs still being updated, easier to host, and installs through Steam (still free!).

### TL;DR: Which to Use?

| Feature            | Warsow           | Warfork          |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Install Ease       | ‚úÖ Brew/Manual    | ‚ùå Steam only     |
| Server Setup       | ‚ùå Tricky         | ‚úÖ LinuxGSM       |
| LAN Friendly       | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Steam needed   |
| Updates            | ‚ùå EOL            | ‚úÖ Active fork     |

**TL;DR**:
- **In-person LAN party?** Use **Warsow**.
- **Remote online party?** Use **Warfork**.
