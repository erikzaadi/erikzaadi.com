Lately I've been going deeper and deeper down the nix rabbit hole at my new work.

The deeper I go, the more I undestand what a nix n00b I am.
I've had so many OMG/AHA! moments, and it reminds me a bit of the period I (re)discovered the Mac, and when my journey of the open source world began.

Here's a small example that'll make anyone with nix experience chuckle, since it's so basic:

When in the middle of a long process such as a download, pressing <del>`ctrl+z`, the download will continue in another process</del> [UPDATE] `ctrl+z` stops the process, if you want it to continue in background u need to run `bg`, freeing the prompt. Enter the command `fg`, and POFF, you're back to the download.


Geekalicious!

Another thing I'm really enjoying learning is Python. It's with its perks of course, but having a REPL to debug and hack around in is awesome!

Exiting times indeed!

Thanks [@theyonibomber](http://codesheriff.blogspot.com/) for the correct answer.
