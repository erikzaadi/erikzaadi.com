I've started to play around with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) lately, and it's amazing.

Without to much effort, I hacked up a script that parses my [.less](http://lesscss.org/) files to css and minifies them, furthermore, the script minifies my javascripts with [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).

The node js automagically runs when I save a .less/.js file, and notifies me via [growl](http://growl.info/) notifications if it's succesful or not..

The ease of setting this up, and the fact that it works flawless both on the Mac and Ubuntu blowed me away.

I'm going to beautify the script and put it up on github soon.

If you have a couple of minutes to spare, install Node.js and hack away, it's worth it!
