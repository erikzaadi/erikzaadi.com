Lately I haven't been able to find myself as much time to work on open source as I used to in the past.

It annoys the hell out of me, but sometimes work + private life = less time to to hack and contribute..

One does have to make a living of course, but I'd love to be able to do is to contribute back to open source from within a working environment that truly appreciates open source.

Anyhow, consider this the `</rant>`
