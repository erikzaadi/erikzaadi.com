Yesterday I delivered a small site to a customer.

The site was not to fancy, simple and strait forward in a "get the job done" kind of way.

When I showed it to the customer he literally lit up, and was really enthusiastic about the quality of the site.

It was a pleasant surprise, as I didn't really have such high thoughts of the design of the site that I did.

Simple works!
