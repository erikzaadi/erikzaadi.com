I've put together a small site that allows you to preview the custom [AtomSite](http://atomsite.net) themes I've done.

Furthermore, you can rate, download and comment the themes at the site, would love some feedback if you liked any theme.

[http://atomsitethemes.erikzaadi.com](http://atomsitethemes.erikzaadi.com)

You'll notice a gray thing on the left :

This is the _compact_ mode of the theme switcher. If you click on the _show_ button you'll see:

This is where you can choose a theme to preview.

The theme switcher can be dragged around, allowing you to see the entire theme you are previewing.

#### Custom Themes

As of the time I'm writing this post, there are 4 custom themes that are (for now) not available out of the box with [AtomSite](http://atomsite.net):

1. [Arclite](http://atomsitethemes.erikzaadi.com/themecollection/Arclite.xhtml)
    This is the theme I'm using currently at this blog, very customizable with variable header, sidebar and content styles.
    Based on [Arclite](http://digitalnature.ro/projects/arclite/) by Digital Nature

2. [Notepad](http://atomsitethemes.erikzaadi.com/themecollection/Notepad.xhtml)

    A smooth theme, however with no variable customizations .

3. [Arjuna-X](http://atomsitethemes.erikzaadi.com/themecollection/ArjunaX.xhtml)

    Very popular wordpress theme, with variable header and side bar styles.

4. [Inove](http://atomsitethemes.erikzaadi.com/themecollection/Inove.xhtml)

    Also a popular wordpress theme, not customizable.
    Based on [inove](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove/) by [neoease](http://www.neoease.com/)

Enjoy!
