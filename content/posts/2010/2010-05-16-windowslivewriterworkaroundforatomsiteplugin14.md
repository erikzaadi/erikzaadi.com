[This post is a follow up to [the workaround for AtomSite 1.3](http://erikzaadi.com/blog/2010/04/16/WindowsLiveWriterWorkaroundForAtomSite13.xhtml)]

I've updated the Windows Live Workaround to the new release of [AtomSite](http://atomsite.net) ([1.4](http://atomsite.net/info/Download.xhtml)).

Thanks to some hierarchical changes made in the new release, deploying the workaround is much easier.

The workaround is built as a plug-in, so you can apply it to any [AtomSite](http://atomsite.net) deployment without the need for compiling source code.

Simply unzip the binaries zip file below to your [AtomSite](http://atomsite.net) root, then access `http://yourblogAddress/WLWWorkaround`

Â 
### _Small disclaimer:_

You should only use this workaround plug-in if you have problems removing the authentication model at your hosting provider.

[Binaries](http://github.com/downloads/erikzaadi/AtomSitePlugins/WLWWorkaround.1.4.0.0.zip) | [Source](http://github.com/erikzaadi/AtomSitePlugins/tree/master/src/WLWWorkaround/)

Enjoy,

Erik
