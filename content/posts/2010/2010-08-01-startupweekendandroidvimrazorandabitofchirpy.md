Whoa, it's been a while since I've written.

A lot of stuff has been going on lately, so this post will be a quick summary..
	
1. Startup Weekend - Tel Aviv
    The second startup weekend in Israel took place in the Peres Peace House, in Yaffo, where Palestinian and Israeli joined forces for a lovely three day hack fest ([http://tel-aviv.startupweekend.org/](http://tel-aviv.startupweekend.org/)) 

    I joined a brilliant idea called MovieOke (Karaoke with movies), and really enjoyed working on the project during the startup weekend..

    You can see the site in action at [http://movieoke.tv](http://movieoke.tv)

    We actually got to first place!

    I'm the one on the left, trying to tuck in my beer belly while being totally blinded by the sun on the beach, more details [here](http://tel-aviv.startupweekend.org/2010/07/30/congratulation/).

2. I've been hacking on an Android application lately (see [post on java](http://erikzaadi.com/blog/2010/07/04/JavaJavaForANietDev.xhtml)).
    This has been a great experience. It's a bit annoying to get used to writing in Java, and the android SDK's xml layouts are a bit rough to get into, but when you get use to the idea, it's a joy.
    Hopefully I'll get some time over to finish the app, so I can publish it here.

3. I've been using (g)Vim a bit more lately. Can't really say I've gotten THE THING about it yet. But the more commands you remember, the more useful it gets..

4. I've experimented a bit with asp.net mvc 3 preview 1, especially with the new Razor view engine. Simply brilliant, finally a more concise templating, ala spark / nhaml.

5. Last but not least, [Chirpy](http://www.weirdlover.com/2010/07/18/chirpy-attains-godlike-abilities-in-version-1-0-0-4/) is an awesome Visual Studio adding that compresses jsand css for you when you save the file.
    Very powerful and useful.
    I forked it to add jQuery as reference when compressing with Google Closure compiler (similar to [this post](http://erikzaadi.com/blog/2010/03/05/CompressJavascriptWithGoogleClosureCompilerInVisualStudiowithJQuerySupport.xhtml)), but then I had some more ideas, hopefully I'll have some time for that as well soon.


Well that's it, a small recap of that I've been about since the
last time.

Cheerios,

Erik
