For the last year and a half I've been heavily exposed to a lot of open source software.  

It started out with a small conversation mentioning [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (Thanks [Tim](http://blog.getintheloop.eu/)!), and since then I've been amazed by the open source community.

The great thing about open source is that you can pay back to the people that created software that you like (Yes, the price is also nice, of course).

I've been using [jQAPI](http://www.jqapi.com/) by [Sebastian Senf](http://mustardamus.com) ([@mustardamus](http://twitter.com/mustardamus)), which is an alternative (and in my personal opinion better) documentation for the jQuery API framework.

Before that, I used the [jQuery API Browser](http://api.jquery.com/browser/), which is also great, and provides a downloadable air file for offline browsing of the API.  

However, it's not been updated to 1.4.2, and lacks that kind of special touch that jQAPI has.

So, after a couple of times of using [jQAPI](http://www.jqapi.com/), I thought, heck, I know [Air](http://adobe.com/air), I'll spend a couple of minutes hacking together a small air wrapper for [jQAPI](http://www.jqapi.com/)..

[Here are the results..](http://demos.erikzaadi.com/js/jQAPI)

_Unfortunately, embedding the air installation badge in the post would have most likely to ruin any rss/atom subscriber reading this post, so we'll have to do with the link :)_

[@mustardamus](http://twitter.com/mustardamus) has been kind enough to both accept my [fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) changes, and to include both credits and a link at [jQAPI](http://www.jqapi.com/)(Thanks!).

The source is at [http://github.com/erikzaadi/jQAPI](http://github.com/erikzaadi/jQAPI)


Enjoy!
