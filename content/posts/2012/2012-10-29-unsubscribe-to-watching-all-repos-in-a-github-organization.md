Github notifications are great, but if you are a part of any organization, 
it quickly get's overrun with repositories that you aren't necessarly active with's notifications, making it hard to filter the important bug reports on you own repos.

To unsubscribe to all repositories in an organization, open up [your watching page](https://github.com/watching) (Login first of course).

Copy the gist below and replace `THEORG` with the organization you wish to unwatch it's repositories.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3973829.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Run it, and you're not watching any more repositories from that organization.

Enjoy,

Erik
