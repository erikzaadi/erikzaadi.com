**TL;DR** - Yet another 'didn't blog in a while due to _ENTER EXCUSES HERE_' post..

#### I've moved on

I now work at [BigPanda](http://bigpanda.io) since March, and until now, I didn't make time to write here..

I did get a chance to write a [blog post](http://blog.bigpanda.io/vagrant-devbox/) at the BigPanda Blog about how we use [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), which was fun writing.

In the end there are only two reasons I stopped blogging.

1. Number one: Refactor Syndrome

   ![REFACTOR ALL THE CODE](/images/refactor_all_the_code.jpg "REFACTOR ALL THE CODE")
   
   Since the last post, I've been trying to rewriting this blog in:
   
   * [Ghost](https://ghost.org)
   * [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io)
   * [Hexo](http://hexo.io/)
   * [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com/)
   * [Punch](http://laktek.github.io/punch/)
   
   Here's another MEME describing how I feel about my progress refactoring:
   
   ![Oh cool, this seems simpllllllleeeaaaaaahhhh](/images/code_refactoring_kitten.gif "Oh cool, this seems simpllllllleeeaaaaaahhhh")

2. Now for the real reason:
